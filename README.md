## Abstract

As students, we realized that there must be a better way to organize tutorials, videos and other learning materials. Thumbtack allows users to organize their saved websites how they want, using nested custom-named folders.

## Snapshots of Application

## Technologies

### Stack

- Apollo Client
- TypeScript
- React with Hooks & Router
- Sass

### Dependencies

- Animate.css
- React-DnD

## Wins

- The Drag-n-Drop API is a very cool library that we were glad to get familiar with for future use
- Using Apollo forced us to think very hard about our component architecture, as our past uses of Context API make that process much easier
- Using TypeScript for the first time made us realize how fragile data flow, especially props and other function arguments, can be in a JS app
- Getting this project across the finish line with a lot of extenuating circumstances thoroughly tested our grit and resolve
- Visual design came together nicely

## Challenges

- We found Apollo Client to have a steep learning curve for such a short project, especially its state management and testing aspects, and found that we needed to pivot away from some features we could've easily implemented with React + Context API
- Mutations from the hosted BE weren't testable from the UI until 2/3 of the way through the project, forcing us to accelerating our cross-team communications and troubleshooting
- A family emergency limited the amount of time we could spend writing code for the first half of this project, so we were not able to start off pair-coding like we planned to
- AWS & Heroku crashed for a day on one of our crucial work days for testing interaction with the hosted BE
